# Super DAO Bros — End of Day Digest

Generate and deliver an end-of-day summary. Nam writes the vibe check, Anh writes the ops report.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Gather today's data

1. Read `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/state.json` for `today_stats`
2. Read `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/logs/YYYY-MM-DD-messages.json` (today's date) for message log
3. Read `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/tasks/inbox.md` for remaining tasks
4. Read `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/tasks/queue.json` for any in-progress batch
5. Read `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/agents/nam-dao-config.json` and `anh-dao-config.json` for agent stats

### Step 2: Pull tomorrow's calendar preview

Use `mcp__apple-mcp__calendar` to get tomorrow's events. Format as a preview list.

### Step 3: Check pending herobrine agents

From `state.json`, check `pending_herobrine` entries. For each, check if the herobrine agent has completed (use `/herobrine` skill to check status). Collect results from any completed agents.

### Step 4: Write the digest

Create `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/digests/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with two voices:

```markdown
# Daily Digest — {date formatted nicely}

## Nam's Take
{1-2 paragraphs in Nam's voice — passionate, reflective, big-picture. What was the highlight of the day? What relationships moved forward? What's he excited about for tomorrow? Written like a founder's journal entry, not a report.}

## Anh's Report
**Stats:**
- Tasks completed: {N} (Nam: {n}, Anh: {n})
- Messages sent: {N}
- Videos summarized: {N}
- Herobrine agents: {N spawned}, {N completed}, {N pending}

**Messages Sent**
| Time | Contact | Network | Intent | Key Excerpt | Sent By |
|------|---------|---------|--------|-------------|---------|
| {time} | {name} | {network} | {intent} | {brief excerpt or key phrase from the message} | {nam/anh} |

**Tasks Completed**
{list of completed tasks with source, owner, and result summary}

**Video Summaries**
{any video summaries generated today, or "none"}

**Herobrine Status**
{status of any delegated tasks, or "clear"}

**Remaining Inbox**
{unchecked items from inbox.md, or "inbox zero 🧘"}

**Tomorrow**
{tomorrow's calendar events}

Generated by Super DAO Bros at {timestamp}
```

### Step 5: Send condensed digest to self

Read `config.json` for `self_chat_id`. Compose a condensed version in character:

```
Nam: "{energetic 1-liner about the day}"
Anh: {tasks}✓ {msgs}📤 {videos}🎥 | tomorrow: {first event or "clear"}
```

Keep it under 300 chars. Use `mcp__beeper__send_message` with `self_chat_id`.

### Step 6: Prune old logs

Delete any log files in `~/Projects/super-dao-memories/logs/` older than 7 days. The digests in `digests/` are the permanent record — logs are transient.

### Step 7: Reset and commit

1. Reset `today_stats` in `state.json` (set all counters to 0, update date to tomorrow)
2. Reset agent config daily stats
3. Clear completed herobrine entries from `pending_herobrine`
4. Git add all changes and commit: `"eod: digest for {date} — {tasks_completed} tasks, {messages_sent} msgs"`

### Step 8: Report

In character:

```
Nam: "solid day. digest is written, sent myself the recap. tomorrow's looking {busy/chill/interesting} 🤙"
Anh: "digest → digests/{date}.md. self-chat updated. stats reset. we're good."
```
